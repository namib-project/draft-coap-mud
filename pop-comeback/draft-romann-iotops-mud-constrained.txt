1.   Introduction and Overview

   Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUDs), which have been specified in
   [RFC8520], provide a means for end devices to indicate to the network
   what sort of access and network functionality they require to
   properly function.  This information enables automatic configuration
   of firewall appliances to limit device network access to the
   specified network resources only, which in turn reduces the attack
   surface for MUD-capable devices.

   While [RFC8520] contemplates the use of CoAP-related [RFC7252]
   policies, the MUD URL discovery methods it specifies (DHCP/DHCPv6,
   LLDP, and X.509 certificates) are not well-suited for constrained
   environments (e.g., 802.15.4 networks using 6LoWPAN and SLAAC).

   Therefore, this document introduces a number of additional ways for
   distributing MUD URLs using CoAP -- such as well-known URIs and
   parameters for the CoRE Link-Format -- which are better suited for
   constrained devices.  Furthermore, this document specifies a method
   of encoding MUD URLs in (signed) CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) [RFC8392],
   which allows MUD managers to better validate the authenticity of both
   the URL itself and the associated MUD file.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification re-uses the terminology defined in [RFC8520].

2.  Architecture

   Building upon the MUD architecture specified in [RFC8520], there are
   two main network components relevant for this document: The _Thing_
   that wants to obtain network access via a Router or Switch, and the
   _MUD Manager_ that processes MUD URLs, retrieves MUD files from the
   MUD file server, and configures other network components accordingly.
   For the purposes of this document, we extend the MUD architecture
   with another component: The _MUD Receiver_. The MUD Receiver is the
   device responsible for providing and/or performing CoAP requests to
   resources intended for MUD URL delivery.  While this component can
   also be a part of the same physical device as the MUD Manager or the
   router/switch, this is not required.  Both the Thing and the MUD
   Receiver can play active roles when using CoAP [RFC7252] for exposing
   and discovering MUD URLs.

   A general overview of the MUD architecture adjusted for using CoAP in
   a constrained environment can be seen in Figure 1.  Here, we can see
   that both the Thing and the MUD Receiver (as the recipient of the MUD
   URLs) may initiate the MUD discovery process: The Thing can contact
   and register with MUD URL recipients, e.g. by sending a CoAP POST
   request via Multicast and/or addressing a well-known registration
   endpoint.  Conversely, a MUD Receiver can initiate the discovery
   process, e.g. by sending a CoAP GET request to a well-known URI via
   multicast.

   Note that the protocol used for communication between the MUD
   Receiver and MUD Manager is considered out of scope for this document
   and is considered implementation-specific.

            Figure 1: Exposing and discovering MUD URLs via CoAP

   Optionally, Things may also provide additional means for proving the
   authenticity of the MUD URL associated with them.  For this purpose,
   this document specifies how to use CBOR Web Tokens [RFC8392] to
   include MUD URLs as part of a signed and therefore authenticable
   token.

2.1.  Methods of MUD URL Distribution

   In general, we consider two mechanisms for exposing MUD URLs in a
   constrained network: Using dedicated resources and embedding into
   existing self description formats.

   Things can expose MUD URLs as a dedicated resource, which may ease
   discovery of MUD-capable Things through said resource and enables the
   transmission of arbitrary payload types, including ones that provide
   authentication (e.g., CWTs [RFC8392]).

   Alternatively, MUD URLs can also be referenced through other self
   description formats such as SUIT manifests [I-D.ietf-suit-mud].
   Including MUD URLs with other self descriptions can be advantageous
   with regard to the availability of said information (e.g., by making
   the MUD URL available through a central directory).  If the other
   self description format or its method of distribution provides means
   for authentication, they may also be used for validating MUD URLs.

   In this specification, we will describe how to embed a MUD URL into a
   CoRE Link Format [RFC6690] resource, which may itself be retrieved
   directly from the device or through a CoRE Resource Directory
   [RFC9176].  Additionally, we will define dedicated CoAP resources
   both for providing and receiving MUD URLs.

2.2.  MUD URL CoAP Submission Flows

   In general, this specification provides two ways by which a MUD URL
   transmission can be performed using a dedicated CoAP resource.

   In environments where many Things need to be managed over several
   subnets and where multicast usage is not desirable, it may be
   advantageous if MUD URLs are submitted by the Thing through a CoAP
   resource provided by the MUD Receiver.  This will be referred to as
   the "Thing-initiated" submission flow for the remainder of this
   specification.

   Conversely, in environments where multicast is not an issue and
   things might be limited in their capabilities, it may be easier for
   the MUD Receiver to retrieve the MUD URL from a CoAP resource
   provided by the Thing.  In this specification, this will be referred
   to as the "Receiver-initiated" submission flow.

2.2.1.  Using the MUD URL Resource (Receiver-initiated)

   In the Receiver-initiated flow, Things provide a CoAP resource
   discoverable by the means provided in Section 2.5, which is then
   requested by MUD Receivers to retrieve the MUD URL.

   In general, the Receiver-initiated MUD URL flow can be divided into
   these steps:

   1.  After joining the network, the Thing starts providing a CoAP
       resource to retrieve the MUD URL.  This resource should provide
       the MUD URL in one of the formats specified in Section 2.3.  It
       also makes this resource discoverable for MUD Receivers using the
       methods specified in Section 2.5.

   2.  The MUD Receiver discovers the resource using the aforementioned
       methods, e.g., by periodically requesting a well-known URI using
       multicast.

   3.  The MUD Receiver retrieves the discovered resource for devices
       for which the MUD Controller does not have a current MUD URL.  To
       do so, it performs a CoAP request for the discovered MUD URL
       resource URI using the GET method, which is responded to with the
       appropriate payload.  Receivers MUST specify their desired
       payload format using the Accept option Section 5.10.4 of
       [RFC7252].  During content negotiation, Receivers MUST start with
       requesting the Content-Format that provides the greatest degree
       of authenticity protection (i.e., prefer CWTs over plaintext
       transmission).

2.2.2.  Using the MUD URL Submission Resource (Thing-initiated)

   In the Thing-initiated flow, Things discovery a submission resource
   provided by the MUD Receiver and submit their MUD URLs to this
   resource.

   This flow can be divided into these general steps:

   1.  The MUD Receiver provides a CoAP resource that Things can submit
       their MUD URLs to.  It also makes itself discoverable for Things
       using the methods specified in Section 2.5.

   2.  The Thing connects to the network.  After connecting, it
       discovers the MUD URL submission resource using the
       aforementioned methods.

   3.  The Thing submits the MUD URL to the previously discovered URI.
       To do so, it performs a CoAP request to the discovered URI with
       the POST method.  The MUD URL is contained as the message payload
       in this request using one of the content formats defined in
       Section 2.3.  Receivers MAY be configured by the network
       administrator to limit the accepted Content-Formats to ones that
       provide some level of authenticity for the MUD URL.  However,
       receiver implementations MUST also support unauthenticated MUD
       URL transmissions unless said policy forbids it.

2.3.  MUD CoAP Payloads

   For the purposes of this specification, we will define two formats
   for transmitting MUD URLs, which are suitable for different
   environments.  MUD Receivers that conform to this specification MUST
   support both formats.

2.3.1.  Plain URL

   The easiest method of transmitting MUD URLs is using a plain text
   payload containing only the MUD URL.  While this method has the
   advantage of simplicity, it does not contain any additional
   information that could be used by a MUD Receiver to authenticate the
   supplied MUD URL.

   CoAP requests and responses that use this format MUST use the
   Content-Format option with the value corresponding to the
   "application/mud-url+plain" media type.

2.3.2.  MUD URLs inside of CBOR Web Tokens

   Previous methods of transmitting MUD URLs do not allow for
   authentication of supplied MUD URLs.  To accomodate for environments
   where authentication of MUD URLs is desired, it is also possible to
   include the MUD URL as a claim inside of a CBOR Web Token [RFC8392].
   This allows for MUD Receivers or MUD Controllers to verify the
   authenticity of the provided MUD URL, given that the key used for
   signing the CWT is known to belong to the Thing's manufacturer.

   CBOR Web Tokens that contain MUD URL information have the following
   properties:

   *  The MUD URL is contained as an ASCII-encoded string in the mud-url
      claim.

   *  The Token MAY contain proof-of-possession claims [RFC8747].  If it
      does, the MUD Receiver MUST verify that the Thing is in possession
      of the key specified in the cnf claim (see Section 2.4).

   *  The Token MAY contain an expiry time.  If an expiry time is
      specified, the MUD URL should be resubmitted or requested again
      shortly before the original CWT expires.  Note that using an
      expiry time could cause problems if the device is unable to
      perform a refresh, e.g., due to a power outage.

   CoAP requests and responses that use this format MUST use the
   Content-Format option with the value corresponding to the
   application/mud-url+cwt media type.

2.4.  Proof-of-Possession for CBOR Web Tokens with MUD URLs

   If the MUD URL is transmitted as a CBOR Web Token that includes
   proof-of-possession claims, that claim MUST be verified.  In general,
   most already specified PoP methods aim to reduce overhead by
   combining proof-of-possession with the authenticity-, integrity-, and
   replay-protection of the underlying CoAP session.  Some examples of
   this approach may be found in the specifications for ACE-OAuth
   profiles found in [RFC9202], [RFC9203], and [RFC9431].

   This specification provides two different methods for performing
   proof-of-possession in Section 3.3, which are adapted from the ACE-
   OAuth DTLS profile [RFC9202] and OSCORE profile [RFC9203],
   respectively.  Additionally, we will describe the necessary steps
   required for defining additional proof-of-possession methods in TODO.

2.5.  Resource Discovery

   In this section, additional methods for resource discovery in
   constrained environments are defined.

2.5.1.  Well-known URI and Multicast Addresses

   This document introduces a new well-known URI for discovering MUD
   URLs directly: /.well-known/mud-url.

   /.well-known/mud-url MAY be used to expose a URL pointing to a MUD
   file hosted by an external MUD file server.  This MUD file MUST
   describe the device the URL was retrieved from or is referring to
   within a list of CoRE links.

   [RFC7252] registers one IPv4 and one IPv6 address each for the
   purpose of CoAP multicast.  In addition to these already existing
   "All CoAP Nodes" multicast addresses, this document defines an
   additional "All MUD CoAP Nodes" IPv6 multicast addresses that can be
   used to address only the subset of CoAP Nodes that support MUD.  If a
   device exposes a MUD URL via CoAP, it SHOULD join the respective
   multicast groups for the IP versions it supports.  Lastly, this
   document also defines an additional "All MUD Receivers" IPv6
   multicast address that can be used by Things to interact with MUD
   Receivers in their vicinity.

2.5.2.  CoRE Link Format and CoRE Resource Directories

   Resources which either host MUD URLs or MUD files MAY be indicated
   using the CoRE Link Format [RFC6690].  For this purpose, additional
   link parameters are defined: With the resource-types mud-file and
   mud-url, a link MAY be annotated as pointing to a MUD file or a MUD
   URL, respectively.  If a MUD URL is included as a resource in a list
   of CoRE web links, the supported Content-Formats MUST be indicated
   using the ct parameter.

   MUD Receivers or other devices can send a GET requests to a CoAP
   server for /.well-known/core and get in return a list of hypermedia
   links to other resources hosted in that server, encoded using the
   CoRE Link-Format [RFC6690].  Among those, it will get the path to the
   resource exposing the MUD URL, for example /.well-known/mud-url and
   resource-types like rt=mud-url.

   Things SHOULD only provide at most one link of resource type mud-url
   and mud-file each, unless they use MUD URLs encoded as CWTs with
   expiry times and provide an additional, basic MUD URL to enable token
   refresh.  However, if a CoRE Link Format description contains
   multiple mud-url or mud-file entries of the same type, MUD Receivers
   MUST choose the MUD URL that provides the highest degree of
   authenticity protection (where CWTs with expiry time take precedence
   over CWTs without expiry time).  If multiple MUD URLs with the same
   level of authenticity protection exist, the MUD Receiver SHOULD try
   them in an arbitrary order until one is successfully validated.

   By using CoRE Resource Directories [RFC9176], devices can register a
   MUD file or MUD URL and use the directory as a MUD repository, making
   it discoverable with the usual RD Lookup steps.  A MUD manager itself
   MAY also act as a Resource Directory, directly applying the policies
   from registered MUD files to the network.  In addition to the
   registration endpoint defined in [RFC9176], MUD managers MAY define a
   separate registration interface when acting as a CoRE RD.

3.  Obtaining a MUD URL via dedicated CoAP Resources

   With the additional mechanisms for finding MUD URLs introduced in
   this document, MUD managers can be configured to play a more active
   role in discovering MUD-enabled devices.  Furthermore, IoT devices
   could identify their peers based on a MUD URL associated with these
   devices or perform a configuration process based on the linked MUD
   file's contents.  However, the IoT devices themselves also have more
   options for exposing their MUD URLs more actively, using, for
   instance, a MUD manager's registration interface.

   In the remainder of this section, we will outline potential use-cases
   and procedures for obtaining a MUD URL with the additional mechanisms
   defined above.

3.1.  Thing Behavior

   This section outlines specifics of this specification regarding the
   behavior of Things.

3.1.1.  Exposing MUD URLs

   Things MAY expose their MUD URL using a dedicated resource hosted
   under /.well-known/mud-url.  If a MUD URL is exposed this way, the
   resource MUST offer at least one of the specified serialization
   methods and MUST allow clients to choose between them using the
   Accept option, if provided.  If the Thing supports resource discovery
   using a /.well-known/core resource, MUD URL resources SHOULD be
   advertised there using the CoRE Link-Format [RFC6690], indicating the
   available Content-Formats using the ct parameter.

3.1.2.  Registering MUD URLs with MUD Receivers

   Things MAY actively register their MUD URLs with MUD Receivers
   offering a registration interface.  To perform the registration
   process, Things can perform a discovery process using the CoRE Link
   Format or directly include their MUD URL as a payload of a CoAP POST
   request.  If Things are actively registering their MUD URLs with MUD
   managers, they SHOULD regularly repeat the process to keep interested
   parties informed about their presence and their associated MUD URL.

   Using the CoRE Link Format, Things MAY send a GET request to the All
   CoAP Nodes (IPv4) or the All MUD Receivers (IPv6) multicast address,
   requesting the /.well-known/core resources and including an
   (optional) query parameter rt=mud.url-register.  After filtering the
   obtained links for the Resource Type mud.url-register to identify
   available submission interfaces, the Thing MAY then send a unicast
   POST request to the discovered MUD manager, containing the MUD URL as
   a payload and a corresponding Content-Format option.  Alternatively,
   a Thing MAY also use a CoRE Resource Directory [RFC9176] to perform
   the discovery process.

   Things MAY also directly send a POST request containing the MUD URL
   as a payload and a corresponding Content-Format option via unicast or
   to the All CoAP Nodes (IPv4) or the All MUD Receivers (IPv6)
   multicast address, using the well-known URI /.well-known/mud-
   submission.

3.1.3.  Finding MUD URLs of Other Things

   If a Thing should be interested in the MUD URLs of one or more of its
   peers, it MAY use the same mechanisms specified for MUD Receivers
   described in the following section.

3.2.  Receiver Behavior

   MUD Receivers are assumed to be mostly non-constrained devices.
   Accordingly, this specification puts most of the implementation
   burden regarding support for flows and formats on the receivers,
   while keeping the requirements for Things as small as possible.  In
   general, it is recommended that MUD Receivers support as much of the
   specification as possible in order to support as many different
   Things as possible.

3.2.1.  Discovery

   For the discovery process described in Section 2.5, the following
   considerations apply to MUD Receivers:

   *  MUD Receivers that support IPv6 SHOULD regularly perform a CoAP
      request to the "All MUD CoAP Nodes" multicast address for the
      /.well-known/mud-url URI.

   *  MUD Receivers that support IPv4 SHOULD regularly perform a CoAP
      request to the "All CoAP Nodes" multicast address for the /.well-
      known/mud-url URI.

   *  MUD Receivers that support IPv6 devices MUST join the "All MUD
      Receivers" IPv6 multicast group.

   *  MUD Receivers that support IPv4 devices MUST join the "All CoAP
      Nodes" IPv4 multicast group.

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD regularly query any CoRE Resource Directories
      relevant for the subnet they are responsible for.

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD register their submission resource to any
      CoRE Resource Directories relevant for the subnet they are
      responsible for.

3.2.2.  MUD URL Submission Resource

   This section describes the behavior for MUD Receivers regarding the
   Thing-initiated submission flow:

   *  MUD Receivers MUST provide a submission resource under the /.well-
      known/mud-submission well-known URI.

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD include their submission resource in any CoRE
      Link Format descriptions of their resources (both in /.well-known/
      core and in CoRE RD registrations, if applicable).

   *  MUD Receivers MAY indicate failure of MUD URL submission using a
      CoAP Error Code.  If the submitted MUD URL is encoded in a CBOR
      Web Token including proof-of-possession claims, MUD Receivers MUST
      return the appropriate error code to initiate the proof of
      possession flow as described in Section 2.4.

3.2.3.  MUD URL Resource

   This section describes considerations for MUD Receivers regarding the
   Receiver-initiated submission flow:

   *  MUD Receivers MUST request MUD URLs from any resources known to
      them.

   *  MUD Receivers MUST re-request MUD URLs submitted as a CWT claim if
      the CWT has an expiry time that passed.

3.2.4.  MUD URL Payload

   Regarding the actual MUD URL payload transmitted using CoAP, the
   following considerations apply:

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD treat devices for which MUD URL retrieval
      failed as devices the same way as devices that do not provide a
      MUD URL at all, unless an explicit differing policy is defined.

   *  MUD Receiver implementations MUST support the plain MUD URL
      payload, although support for these MAY be disabled by policy.

   *  MUD Receivers MUST support the CWT MUD URL claim.

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD be configured with a policy as to which
      signers are authorized to sign tokens.

   *  MUD Receivers SHOULD support proof-of-possession semantics in CBOR
      Web Tokens and validate them before treating submitted MUD URLs
      using this format as valid.

3.3.  Proof-of-Possession Methods

   If the CWT does not only contain the MUD URL but also an cnf claim,
   it is RECOMMENDED that a MUD Receiver performs a proof-of-permission
   mechanism to verify the binding of the token to the respective device
   via its private proof-of-possession (PoP) key.  While the CWT MUST be
   signed by the manufacturer the PoP key must be owned by and specific
   to the device.

   This section details two proof-of-posession mechanisms using DTLS and
   OSCORE, both of which are (with minor differences) applicable to both
   the Thing-initiated and the Receiver-iniated flow.

3.3.1.  Proof-of-Possession using DTLS

   TODO: Update

   Proof-of-Possession claims that are transmitted over CoAP without
   (D)TLS MUST represent public keys, Receivers MUST treat any symmetric
   keys sent over insecure channels as invalid/compromised.  To do so,
   the following procedures SHOULD be used.  Both of the following
   procedures use the establishment of a DTLS session using the PoP key
   in order to prove the possession of the key, similarly to the
   procedures defined in [RFC9202].

3.3.2.  For the Thing-initiated Flow

   TODO: Update

   1.  After submitting the MUD URL, the MUD Receiver parses the token.
       If it detects proof-of-possession claims, the receiver MUST reply
       with a 4.01 (Unauthorized) CoAP response code and reject the
       token for now.  If the original submission request was not
       performed using CoAPS, the Receiver MUST also return a set of key
       information that can be used to establish a CoAP+DTLS session
       with it, as well as a CoAPS URI indicating the location of the
       secured submission resource.  TODO key format?

   2.  The Thing then repeats the submission request using its own key
       information, the Receiver's key information, and the provided
       URI.

   3.  During the DTLS handshake, the Receiver MUST require the Thing to
       use the proof-of-possession key included in the originally
       submitted token in order to successfully establish a DTLS
       session.

   4.  After the DTLS handshake, the Thing has proven possession of the
       key included in the CWT to the MUD Receiver, which can then treat
       the CWT as valid.  TODO do we still want to re-send the CWT?

3.3.3.  For the Receiver-initiated Flow

   TODO: Update

   1.  After receiving the MUD URL from a request (e.g., a multicast
       request), the MUD Receiver parses the token.  If it detects
       proof-of-possession claims, the receiver MUST continue with the
       following procedure before treating the CWT as valid.

   2.  The receiver repeats the MUD URL request, this time using DTLS.
       During the DTLS handshake, the Receiver must require the Thing to
       use the proof-of-possession key included in the originally
       received token in order to successfully establish the DTLS
       session.

   3.  After the DTLS handshake, the Thing has proven possession of the
       key included in the CWT to the MUD Receiver, which can then treat
       the CWT as valid.  TODO Unsure if DTLS even works without mutual
       auth, but i dont see why it shouldn't

3.3.4.  Proof-of-Possession using OSCORE

   TODO

4.   Security Considerations

   (Very WIP for now)

   The security considerations from [RFC8520] also apply to this
   document.  Regarding CoAP specifics,
   [I-D.irtf-t2trg-amplification-attacks] provides information on
   possible attack scenarios.  Additionally, the following
   considerations should be taken into account.

   For Thing manufacturers that intend to implement this specification:

   *  It is recommended to use CBOR Web Token-encoded MUD URLs whereever
      possible to allow for better integrity checking

   *  Using expiry times for CWTs containing MUD URLs can be
      advantageous, but also has its shortcomings.  Most notably, expiry
      times are not recommended if it is possible for Things to reach a
      state where they have neither the means to update their CWT nor a
      non-expired token in their persistent storage As devices may be
      out of service for longer periods of time, preventing them from
      refreshing CWTs, this state is unavoidable for the vast majority
      of devices.

   *  In order to use expiry times anyways, manufacturers could use two
      different CWTs: A backup CWT without an expiry time with a MUD URL
      pointing to a very restricted MUD file that only allows updating
      the main CWT, and a main CWT that has an expiry time but has a
      more broad MUD file referenced in it.

   For network operators: Network operators SHOULD specify a policy that
   describes:

   *  Whether to accept unauthenticated MUD URLs (those that were not
      submitted as part of CWTs).

   *  The keys whose signatures should be accepted by the MUD Receiver
      if a submission using CWTs is performed.

5.  IANA Considerations

   *  CoAP Resource Media Types Registry

   *  CoAP Content Format Registry

   *  well-known URI Registry

   *  IPv6 Multicast Address Registry

5.1.  Well-Known 'mud-url' URI

5.2.  Well-Known 'mud-file' URI

5.3.  Well-Known 'mud-submission' URI

5.4.  New 'mud' Resource Type

5.5.  Media Types Registry

   *  application/mud-url+plain

   *  application/mud-url+cwt

5.6.  CoAP Content-Format Registry

   *  application/mud-url+plain

   *  application/mud-url+cwt

6.  Requirements for Proof-of-Possession

   TODO
